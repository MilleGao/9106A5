## Overview

Mandy is a Student Center assistant in the University of Sydney who chooses to take the train to work every day because of traffic congestion. One journey that takes an hour. She believes that some sustainable modes of transport, such as Uber, are more expensive and she would only take it if it was off-peak or in an urgent situation. However, if it is an environmentally friendly mode of transport, she is 50% more likely to take it. She repeatedly emphasised that cost is the most important factor in choosing transport, and expressed her hope that there would be some discount promotions. Assuming that technology and transport advances in the future, she considered that not only would transport choices change, but everything would change.

Karen is an education officer for ADP and her daily journey to work by car is about 15 minutes. This is one of the most time and cost-efficient ways for her. In the past, she used to cycle to work. Bicycles are an affordable means of transport for everyone, but it takes someone with time, stamina and energy. Because the roads are not flat and there are not so many bike lanes in Sydney, drivers don't like to share the road with cyclists and cyclists can be very dangerous. She said that convenience is the first factor in her choice of transport because the transport system here is not so reliable and there are often late and cancelled public transport. It would also be helpful if the bus company would give some discounts on transport, as many people consider the cost of travelling in such a trend where the cost of living is gradually rising. Considering the efficiency and convenience of choosing a car, she has already booked a hybrid car and if in the future everyone buys an electric car, she hopes that there will be more charging points, which will help city residents to choose sustainable transport.

Adrian is a senior project officer at the School of Architecture Design Planning and his daily commute is a 30-minute train journey. The environmental impact of carbon emissions is significant, which is something he does consider, and he has known about and travelled on electric buses, but they are not a commuting option. The pricing for those rideshare, scooter, etc. is not cheap either, and the train would be a better option in comparison. He also expressed that price and time are both important considerations when choosing a commute, with the time cost being a priority for him. In addition, for the new transport construction in Sydney, he feels that the cost may exceed the current price of public transport. The government could play a role in providing cheaper transport services, and organisations such as businesses could be involved, giving subsidies and so on to allow people to travel more efficiently. In the next few years he would like to see cheaper e-bikes being used more often. But congestion is also a big factor in traffic during busy times, so it would be helpful if the government could look at the pricing structure and set a congestion tax or more hours with peak and flat prices.

Jahmina, a student centre assistant who travels about an hour a day by bus and train, is not inclined to opt for some of the newer modes of transport, stating that public transport is rare in her area, except for buses and trains. However, assuming that there is a proven more environmentally friendly mode of transport, she would be willing to try it provided if it is not very costly, so for her, price is an important factor in choosing a mode of transport. She also mentioned that train lines at this stage are regularly upgraded or closed, which affects a lot of commuting workers. She saw that they would complain about whether to pay full price for this, as the bus replacement was their only option and the service was not as good as the train, which in her opinion was not convenient. In the future, if there are more reliable alternatives in NSW, she would obviously prefer them, but it's all unknown at this point and she can't give a definitive answer.


### A-Participant 6 - Mandy

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ INTRO

</aside>

Hello, Can I get your name, your job and your current commuting choice?

> My name is Mandy. I am a Student Center assistant in the University of Sydney. I took public transportation, I took the train to Redfern station.
> 

Why do you choose this commuting choice?

> The parking space in here is limited. The traffic jam is really serious in Sydney. It's easy and convenient to choose to take the train to go to work.
> 

How much does it cost you every day?

> Less than $10.
> 

How long does it take you to here?

> From point to point from my place to the train station and taking the trains to Redfern station and Redfern station to the campus takes about an hour.
> 

How much do you think your choice is affecting the environment and do you think it matters?

> Definitely because my place is not that convenient. Is that isn't any train station in my suburb, I need to go to another suburb to take the train.
>

ðŸ’¡ Sustainable Commuting Options

</aside>

- What do you know about sustainable transportation options for low to middle-income individuals, such as electric buses, trams or car-sharing services?

Have you ever chosen a transportation method such as electric bus/ tram/ ride-sharing?

Yes, but not for work.

At night, the train is not that convenient.

- How accessible and affordable do you think these sustainable transportation options are in Sydney?

Do you think these methods are accessible and affordable to you? If not, in which
way do you think they need improvements?

> If you take an Uber it means that you are affordable for that. Yeah, not frequently, not many times, but sometimes it's really expensive. It has seasonal price. Usually, it is off peak period. And then there's isn't any other transportation I will take the Uber.
> 
- Are you willing to sacrifice a certain level of convenience or pay a higher cost to minimize the environmental impact of your commute?

If there is a new eco-friendly transportation method, but you may sacrifice convenience or pay higher, on what scale might you try it?

> If itâ€™s environmental-friendly, that it's going to take expensive, I will half-half.
> 

It depends on how much it increased.

> Yeah. How urgent I am at the moment.

- What gaps or barriers do you see in the current public transportation system that make it difficult for low- to middle-income individuals to choose more sustainable commuting options?

What is the main barrier to choosing a transportation in Sydney in your opinion (e.g.
costs/ lack of information/ low convenience)?

> Costs are the main reason.

</aside>

- What types of local organizations (e.g., nonprofit, business, or government) do you think should be involved in promoting sustainable transportation?

What type of organization do you think can be involved in promoting NSW transportation?

> I think is the public organization, NSW transport.
> 
- Would you be more inclined to choose sustainable transportation if a partner offered incentives (e.g., discounts on the price of trolley tickets, discounts on electric vehicle charging stations, etc.)?

Okay, Will you have a preference for the transportation service with a discount/promotion?

> Yes, but I havenâ€™t got anyâ€¦
> 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Future Trends

</aside>

- In the next few years, do you plan to change your commute to a more sustainable direction?

Are you going to change your transportation in the next 5 years?

> I don't think so. Because I sometimes used to get the Uber or when is the private cars. If I go to the road trip instead of buying a new car also hiring a car. I'm also going to like the sharecar spot.
> 
- What are your thoughts on upcoming technological advances or policy changes that may make sustainable transportation more accessible and affordable?

Do you think the upcoming technological advances or policy changes will affect your choice for transportation?

> I don't think so. Because if the technology is advanced, everything's gonna be changed not just environmental transportation, not just one side, both sides will be advancing and enhancing as well.
> 

Okay, thank you. That's all for our interview.

### A-Participant 7 - Karen

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ INTRO

</aside>

Hello, Can I get your name, job and your current commuting choice?

> My name is Karen. I am the Education Officer for ADP. I am 31, and my current commuting choice because I drive to work.
> 

Why do you choose to drive here?

> I live really close by, parking is cheaper than catching the train. So that's like a cost factor. And it's just in terms of like driving. It's just a little bit more convenient than catching a bus and then walking to work. Yeah, so I save time.
> 

So how much does it cost approximately per day?

> Well, $5 for parking every day. And I mean, I don't know how much fuel costs but yeah, maybe a few dollars. I probably refuel once a fortnight I don't drive the most fuel efficient car at the moment. I've ordered a hybrid car, but it hasn't come yet. So I'm wasting a lot of money on petrol.
> 

It usually takes about half a year or more time to get the new car here right?

> It's taken me nearly a year. Yeah, Nearly. So we're looking to get a hybrid car because obviously it's just more cost efficient for the moment, yeah. And for me to fuel up it costs like $120 or like a 50 liter take a car. And usually I have to refuel every fortnight which is not great, by the way. Yeah.
> 

How long does it take you to here?

> It takes me 15 minutes to drive to work. So from door to door. 15 minutes. Yeah.
> 

How much do you think your choice is affecting the environment and do you think it matters?

> I like to think that I want to live sustainably but because of time in the morning and just like my lifestyle choices like getting home in time to go to the gym. Going into like the classes that I want to go to. I drive to work, which is not ideal for me. But because of saving time and then getting home to do other things I choose to drive. Yeah, and also because it's like, only like a 15 minute drive. Yeah. That's just my choice.
> 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Sustainable Commuting Options

</aside>

- What do you know about sustainable transportation options for low to middle-income individuals, such as electric buses, trams or car-sharing services?

Have you ever chosen a transportation method such as electric bus/ tram/ ride-sharing?

> Not in Sydney. So when I lived in London, I used to cycle to work. Oh, and I would cycle like an hour. But I choose not to do that here because it's not flat. And because there's not that many cycle lanes or bike lanes in Sydney. It's a bit trickier. And drivers don't like to share the road with cyclists. So to me, maybe it just feels a little bit more dangerous. So I've cycled in China, I've cycled in London, I've cycled in like other countries, and there's just more cycle highways. So you feel like you can safely ride on that part of the road whereas here in Sydney, there's just not that many cycling lanes.
> 
- How accessible and affordable do you think these sustainable transportation options are in Sydney?

Do you think these methods are accessible and affordable to you? If not, in which
way do you think they need improvements?

> I think that, in terms of cycling, it's certainly probably, you know, Ticks sustainability box, ticks the exercise box. But and you know, bikes are not that expensive to buy. So yeah, I think it's accessible, affordable and sustainable. But I think that because it's just not enough cycle lanes. Like right now I live close to work. So if I wanted to cycle I probably could. But Sydney is so big. And if someone was if someone lived like you know, half an hour away by car, then it's not sustainable but like accessible for them to like cycle to work unless they have the time and they have the stamina and energy to like cycle like hills that we have.
> 
- Are you willing to sacrifice a certain level of convenience or pay a higher cost to minimize the environmental impact of your commute?

If there is a new transportation method, but you may sacrifice convenience or pay higher, on what scale might you try it?

> Well, before I drove, I used to catch the bus and walk. So that is definitely an option for me. But I scale it as low because it just takes triple the time for me to get to work. And I live in an area that is quite dense and there's a lot of international students. So I have to share the bus and I have to share the walk and it adds more time for me because the buses get really full and then walking from like Redfern station to here. You know, it's just slower to get to work was driving is just like my comfort and the faster. May listening to some music and a bit more karma. For me the buses okay. It's more than walk. Because sometimes like, I don't know if you guys walk from Redfern station. That one street was so narrow. And because the bus doesn't take me all the way to work. That walk can sometimes be like 10, 15 minutes. So  if I just drive it just it saves me time and also parking, when it's not during semester there's a lot of like parking along Mays prison. But now that like most students are driving to work as well. I have to get here earlier, so that I can get a car spot. So I now start work earlier because I drive to work earlier to get like a car spot as well.

ðŸ’¡ Barriers to Sustainable Transportation

</aside>

- What gaps or barriers do you see in the current public transportation system that make it difficult for low- to middle-income individuals to choose more sustainable commuting options?

What is the main barrier to choosing a transportation in Sydney in your opinion (e.g.
costs/ lack of information/ low convenience)?

> Um, probably convenience is the main one in time. I don't think like our transportation system is very reliable, or efficient. So sometimes you know, there's so many canceled delayed trains or sometimes they don't take you exactly where you need to go to they don't come as frequently. So driving feels like you know, the most convenient but you know sometimes parking is an issue. You know, if I want to go Surry hills. I will not drive there because there's just not enough parking.

</aside>

- What types of local organizations (e.g., nonprofit, business, or government) do you think should be involved in promoting sustainable transportation?

What type of organization do you think can be involved in promoting NSW transportation?

> I think the government is the main one.
> 
- Would you be more inclined to choose sustainable transportation if a partner offered incentives (e.g., discounts on the price of trolley tickets, discounts on electric vehicle charging stations, etc.)?

Will you have a preference for the transportation service with a discount/promotion?

> Yeah, I think discounts are always helpful. Because like you said, like the cost of living is already so expensive. And you know, like I said, I drive because it's cheaper than catching public transport. So if that's cheaper, then I get to be comfortable. It's faster than I've I would definitely consider like all the costs involved as well.
> 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Future Trends

</aside>

- In the next few years, do you plan to change your commute to a more sustainable direction?

Are you going to change your transportation in the next 5 years?

> Well, once I get my hybrid car, I think I'm on the way to choosing a more sustainable choice. But you know, in five years time, personally, I might have children. So efficiency and convenience, probably still car but, you know, trains will be trains probably be a good one. I prefer catching a train over a bus because I don't like traffic. But we'll see what the government's like in five years time as well.
> 
- What are your thoughts on upcoming technological advances or policy changes that may make sustainable transportation more accessible and affordable?

So upcoming technological advances or policy changes will affect your opinion?

> I think so. Yeah. Like ideally, if we can get if I can buy electric car, that's ideal. But at the same time, because there's a lot of electric cars but not enough charging point. Or I don't live in a house and the apartment like in the garage there's no charging points. So if more electric cars are being sold, then hopefully there'll be more availability of charging points and that I'm all about convenience as you can probably tell, so yeah. I would say that would be helpful in choosing sustainable transportation.

### C-Participant 12 - Adrian

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ INTRO

</aside>

Hello, thank you for coming today for the interview. Our research is about how the rising living pressure cost impacts your current commuting transportation choice. Will you consent to being audio recorded?

> Yeah.
> 

Okay, Are you ready to start?

Yep.

What is your name, job, age, and current commuting choice?

> My name is Adrian. I am a senior project officer at the School of Architecture Design Planning at the University of Sydney. My main commuting choice would be the train.
> 

Okay, why do you choose train?

> So it's the easiest option for me from where I live to get to work. There are other options I can take a car or a bus, but it's the quickest and the easiest to get to.
> 

So how much does it cost you one day?

> I think it's about it's so I don't go straight from where I lived to university. I actually did make a stop beforehand. So I head into the city to go to the gym, and then I come back to Redfern. But I think it's about $6 One way, so about $12 a day.
> 

So how long does it take you door to door?

> So to door to door would be probably about like a five minute car ride down to the station. And then about 15 minutes into the city. Well I guess to work, it would be 10 minutes on the train and then about a 10 minute walk. So what's that? That's 25 One way so then yeah, door to door about 30 minutes.
> 

How much do you think your choice is affecting the environment do you think it matters?

> I do think it matters. I don't normally take a car when I commute to work. So I think I am thinking about those situations already. And it is quite, I guess an efficient way of getting to work in terms of carbon emissions and all that sort of stuff. So yeah, I think it's it is something that I do think about.
> 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Sustainable Commuting Options

</aside>

- What do you know about sustainable transportation options for low to middle-income individuals, such as electric buses, trams or car-sharing services?

Okay. Have you ever chosen methods such as electric bus, tram ride sharing or bus bike sharing?

> I have taken an electric bus. I haven't used a scooter or electric bike before. Not get to work.
> 
- How accessible and affordable do you think these sustainable transportation options are in Sydney?

Do you think that this method are accessible and affordable to you?

> They are accessible. Affordable, not so much I think trying to weigh up the cost between because normally with those like the rideshare, scooters and bikes, it's by kilometer. So it does take it does add up as you... I guess go those distances. So for me, it's probably about I think 15 Ks to get to work which probably would add up quite quickly and quite substantially so the train works out to be a better option.
> 
- Are you willing to sacrifice a certain level of convenience or pay a higher cost to minimize the environmental impact of your commute?

If there is a brand new transportation method, you may sacrifice your convenience or pay more, on what scale, you might try it?

> Yeah, so I think pricing is probably a very big one. I think it's levels of convenience. So whether I can how frequent the services or like where I can pick up whatever I'm picking up. It's the cost of it. So it's whether it's cheaper or not, but I think if you give me a scenario where one is cheaper, but it takes longer, but one is more expensive, but it's quicker, I probably would pick the quicker one because time is important and you want to get to places quickly. So I think if there was that kind of decision then probably go for quicker.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Barriers to Sustainable Transportation

</aside>

- What gaps or barriers do you see in the current public transportation system that make it difficult for low- to middle-income individuals to choose more sustainable commuting options?

I see. What is the main barrier to new transportation constructions and marketing in Sydney in your opinion?

> I think it's cost is probably a big one. And also, location of like where the actual metro station is going. I guess because I live in somewhere that's quite central. There is a lot of services already. So there isn't really a need for extra infrastructure to be in that location. I guess the one thing would be that it's that kind of last mile rides I don't know if you've heard about it or, or researched about it but getting people to destinations, whether it be work or home. It's fine up until the last mile they call it in which is the last kilometer between like getting to the station or whatever. That's the pinch point. And I'm lucky that I still live at home so my dad goes to work in the morning and I can line it up quite well that you can drive me down to the station. But buses are infrequent. They're always late as well. You never know when they're gonna turn up. And I think if there was some sort of model where electric share bikes or scooters hadn't been more prevalent in that last mile it'd be be quite good.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Partnerships

</aside>

- What types of local organizations (e.g., nonprofit, business, or government) do you think should be involved in promoting sustainable transportation?

Okay, what type of organization do you think can be involved in cheaper transportation, like the government?

> Yeah, I think government definitely does have a role to play. That being said, as well, I think it would be interesting to see like organizations like businesses take up Moreover, a stance where they might say if you take the train to work instead of taking your car, which is a cost on them for parking, then we will, I don't know, give you an extra 1% or something or no allowance to pay for that. But definitely government is a big one where I think it's the mode of journey, transfer the changing from like train to bus to ferry, which I think could be worked on or even like a more efficient like, off peak on peak situation as well pricing structure which is more competitive.
> 

If it's eco-friendly transportation you may pay more. So are you willing to choose them?

> Yeah, I think so.
> 
- Would you be more inclined to choose sustainable transportation if a partner offered incentives (e.g., discounts on the price of trolley tickets, discounts on electric vehicle charging stations, etc.)?

Have you ever tried the transportation service with a discount or promotion?

> Well, yeah, I get Yes. I guess off-peak, you can kind of say is a discount on the train. So I think before COVID Off Peak used to be a bit more achievable. They've extended the hours for the off-peak now. But I remember when I was back at uni, I think of peak started it might have started before like four o'clock so you wouldn't I would always remember like trying to get to the train station quicker because then it would be a bit cheaper whereas these days, the shorter periods of where the peak is much longer. So it's quite hard.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Future Trends

</aside>

- In the next few years, do you plan to change your commute to a more sustainable direction?

Which kind of transportation are you going to choose in the next five years?

> Train, busâ€¦car. I'd like to see more uptake of cheaper electric bikes and scooters. I think that's something that I'd like to do.
> 
- What are your thoughts on upcoming technological advances or policy changes that may make sustainable transportation more accessible and affordable?

Okay. And the last person question, I think you have answered is the upcoming technological advances and the policy changes will affect your choice in the future.

> Yeah, I guess the move towards more electric vehicles and bikes and scooters and a more competitive pricing structure around them is important. I guess the important thing to note is an electric vehicle is great, but you're still part of congestion. So whether it's a petrol car or electric car is no different when you're in a busy period, because you're still adding to congestion so I think it's around whether like governments can look into pricing structures, whether there's like, more congestion taxes or like certain periods of time, which try and get people more people from cars to train, bus, all that sort of stuff.

Okay, that's all for our interview. Thanks for your time. Thank you so much.

Okay. So what do you think the cost of this method?

> I honestly, I don't because I don't see it as much of an option for me. Usually, where I see it, it's when I'm walking to another place. So I would rather just walk instead of using one of, for example, the electric bikes or the electric scooters. If I ever see them and it's available to me it's usually if I'm walking somewhere so it's not to me it's not a better option than walking. Especially because a lot of times I don't have a helmet so I'm not going to ride a bike without a helmet.

- Are you willing to sacrifice a certain level of convenience or pay a higher cost to minimize the environmental impact of your commute?

If there is a brand new transportation method, but you may sacrifice convenience or pay higher, on what scale might you try it?

> I think if it was something that was proven to be more environmentally friendly, that's something I would definitely be willing to pay a little bit extra for. Not if it would cost me double what I'm paying. I think if it was only a little bit extra, I would definitely. Unfortunately, pricing is going to be a big factor for a lot of people but if it's proven to be environment, a lot more environmentally friendly. It's still a better option than most and I would hope that people who drive would select that as an option.

ðŸ’¡ Barriers to Sustainable Transportation

</aside>

- What gaps or barriers do you see in the current public transportation system that make it difficult for low- to middle-income individuals to choose more sustainable commuting options?

What is the main barrier to new transportation construction (e.g., metro, tram) and marketing in Sydney in your opinion (e.g., costs/ lack of information/ low convenience)?

> For me, it's not those transports aren't available in my specific area just yet. So I don't have tram in my suburb. So I'm more self on the train line. So those options aren't really an option for me at all, because they haven't rolled it out everywhere. So tram isnâ€™t an option. Metro isn't an option is just regular trains and buses.

ðŸ’¡ Partnerships

</aside>

- What types of local organizations (e.g., nonprofit, business, or government) do you think should be involved in promoting sustainable transportation?

What type of organization do you think can be involved in cheaper transportation (e.g., nonprofit, business, or government)?

> I think the government should be responsible for that for sure.
> 
- Would you be more inclined to choose sustainable transportation if a partner offered incentives (e.g., discounts on the price of trolley tickets, discounts on electric vehicle charging stations, etc.)?

Have you ever tried the transportation service with a discount/ promotion (e.g., discounts on the price of trolley tickets, discounts on electric vehicle charging stations, etc.)?

> No, I don't think I have usually most of them are just the government ones overall.

ðŸ’¡ Future Trends

</aside>

- In the next few years, do you plan to change your commute to a more sustainable direction?

Which kind of transportation are you going to choose in 5 years?

> Most likely just the transport NSW, so just the government-funded ones.
> 
- What are your thoughts on upcoming technological advances or policy changes that may make sustainable transportation more accessible and affordable?

So the upcoming technological advances or policy changes won't affect your choice in the next five years?

> Most likely, I don't think there's going to be that big of a difference, but there'll be that many options for me, I think, most likely it would be the standard transport NSW that would be the best and most reliable option if there was something that arose in the next five years that was more reliable. I would definitely it. If it was a little bit extra and it was more reliable. I'd obviously prefer to pick that. But I think we're quite a few years away from that.
> 

How much do you think your choice is affecting the environment and do you think it matters?

> It definitely matters. I think choosing public transport is definitely something that really helps having, you know, 50 people on one motor vehicle as opposed to just one person in one car I think makes a big difference.
> 

Okay, thatâ€™s all for me, do you have any questions wanna add?

Maybe I want to ask you something about construction parts. Have you ever seen any construction for transportation, like around you?

> Yeah, so I know that they're doing construction at Redfern whether that's just enabling more accessible option for the station itself or whether they're implementing metro or other options for Redfern station. My mum, for example is she lives on the Canterbury line which they're currently updating and they're actually going to be shutting down that train line for the next year apparently. The Bankstown line is going to be shut down while they upgraded for the metro. So that may eventually happen to my train line, but my train line is fine. There's no construction happening.
> 

Do you have any plans for that time? Maybe you will try something like buses or during the train that was shut down?

> So that's not my train line at this stage. I know that they're planning on just adding more bus services because that's kind of the only option that they will have. A lot of people actually complained about whether or not they should be paying full price for that considering it's going to not be as good as the train services. But at this stage, I'm not personally affected by it, but I've seen that happen to other people. So it's based online specifically it's going to be, it hasn't been shut down yet, but they are going to be shutting it down for an entire year. Minimum, which is probably going to be longer than that.
